# airline-scheduling-sandbox

Are you a bad airline looking for a way to decide which routes to fly? This is the repo for you

## The Problem

Airline route selection is a very difficult and interesting problem. You aim to choose the set of routes which will generate the most profit, yet there are significant difficulties. The combinatorics of different possible route combinations is insane. Modeling consmer demand is difficult. Moding consumer behavior when faced with alternative routes/ costs is difficult. etc. This repo is a sandbox to mess around with different algorithms to approach this problem. 

## Whats inside

* utils: general utilities
* data: data files containing cities, plane fleets, etc
* algorithms: the cool stuff
